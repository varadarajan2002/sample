create repository 
ensure you are using proper syntax like inoder to add a file u have to use git add .\filename.txt
next use git commit inoder to push the code into the staging area and that file will get tracked
next use git push command to push the code into the cloud or the repository 

next use git pull command to update even if somone have already worked on ur repo and this pull will make ur file updated

next we are to see about status use git status command
this tells about the status whether the file is in staging or untracked or it has already been pushed in the cloud or repo

next git branch this will tell about the current branch we are working

next to create a new branch use git checkout -b branchname

to change the branch use git checkout old branch name or branch name



origin is the clone url 

note:::::: whenever u are making a change in local syatem or in cloud or repo it is very important to first add and commit and push 
otherwise the changes will not be saved in git

git stash command is used to delete it works like a recycle bin
git stash pop is used to retrive the previously deleted file

git log command is used to show the number of commits and what kind of commits u have done
thankyou!!!
